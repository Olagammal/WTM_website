# WOMAN TECH MAKERS

This is a simple static website built using HTML and CSS only.This site contain a home page,a signup and login page.

## The things i learned in this iteration-(08-03-2020): 

I have learnt the use of forms and the alignment of various elements more clearly.

## 10 things that need improvement:
	- Javascript can be used for form validation.
	- Images can be used in home page.
	- Good background should be chosen for homepage.
	- Good and relevant content should be added in homepage.
	- Navbar can be made more interesting.
	- Footer can be added.
	- Logo can be used in navbar.
	- The webpage can be a theme-specific one.
	- The overall layout can be improved.
	- Font style in the homepage can be changed.

###Here are my few suggestions:
	1.signup and login given at the middle of home page is not necessary
	2.the signup and login menu in navbar can be replaced with login menu alone.
	3.The navbar can be in fixed position while scrolling
	4.The layout of the website can be made to look as professional.
	5.A logo can be given for the site
	6.The contact section can be given at the bottom of home page
	7.The validation issues should be fixed for signup and login.
	8.If a user logins, an account has to be created.
	9.The information displayed should be relevant to WTM.
	10.The about section should be fed with information related to WTM.
	11.The site can contain more menus for theme,events,etc.
	12.The contact section can have social media links through icons.
